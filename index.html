                <h1>Buy-Sell Agreements</h1>
                <p>ESOP's must have business valuations done annually for record keeping purposes as well as every time the ESOP buys or sells stock. To do a business valuation for an ESOP, an appraiser must be well-versed in both government compliance requirements for ESOP valuations and the impacts on value of differing ESOP structures and financing.

Such an opinion is always required when when one of the shareholders is an ESOP.

                <h1>Issuance of Stock Options</h1>
                <p>When a privately-held company decides to issue stock options it needs to have its stock valued so it can set the strike price (also known as the exercise price) of the stock options.

                It is often advisable to create a buy-sell agreement that clearly establishes the valuation provisions for the stock that will be received upon exercise of the stock options.
